# Bedsheet Size Data Extraction

This project demonstrates how to extract data from a web page, specifically a bedsheet size chart, and export it to an Excel file using Python. The project utilizes the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` libraries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of fetching bedsheet size data from a website and organizing it into a structured format that can be easily analyzed or used for further processing. The data is extracted from a table on the webpage and is then exported to an Excel file.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- `requests`: To make HTTP requests and fetch the HTML content from the web page.
- `BeautifulSoup4`: To parse the HTML content and extract the required data.
- `pandas`: To organize the extracted data into a DataFrame and export it to an Excel file.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## Project Workflow

1. **Fetch HTML Content**: The script starts by sending an HTTP GET request to the specified URL to fetch the HTML content of the web page.

2. **Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup**: The fetched HTML content is then parsed using BeautifulSoup to create a parse tree, allowing for easy extraction of specific elements.

3. **Extract Data**: The script locates the table containing the bedsheet size data and extracts all rows (`<tr>` tags) from the table. Each row is further broken down into individual cells (`<td>` tags), and the text content is extracted and cleaned.

4. **Organize Data**: The extracted data is organized into a list of lists, which is then converted into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is structured with columns corresponding to the type of bedsheet and its respective dimensions.

5. **Export to Excel**: Finally, the DataFrame is exported to an Excel file named `Sheet.xlsx`. The index is not included in the Excel file for a cleaner output.

## Running the Script

Simply run the Python script in your preferred environment:

```bash
python script.py
```

After execution, the bedsheet size data will be saved in an Excel file named `Sheet.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.

## Note

Ensure that the URL in the script points to the correct webpage containing the bedsheet size chart. The structure of the table on the webpage should match the scriptâ€™s parsing logic.

# Column_ADD.xlsx Script

This Python script creates an Excel file named `Column_ADD.xlsx` using the `openpyxl` library. The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Workbook and Sheet Creation**:
   - A new workbook is created, and the active sheet is selected.

2. **Assign Values to Column A**:
   - The value `12` is assigned to every cell in column A (from row 1 to row 10).

3. **Assign Values to Column B**:
   - The values from a predefined list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` are assigned to column B (from row 1 to row 10).

4. **Sum Values of Columns A and B**:
   - The script iterates through each row (1 to 10), retrieves the values from columns A and B, and calculates their sum.
   - The sum is then stored in column C for the corresponding row.

5. **Optional Alternative Method**:
   - A commented-out alternative method shows how to directly use Excel formulas to calculate the sum of columns A and B in column C.

6. **Save Workbook**:
   - The final workbook is saved with the filename `Column_ADD.xlsx`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `openpyxl` library installed (`pip install openpyxl`)

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python and the `openpyxl` library installed.
2. Copy the script to your preferred location.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. The output file `Column_ADD.xlsx` will be created in the same directory as the script.

## Explanation

- **Column A**: Contains the value `12` for rows 1 to 10.
- **Column B**: Contains values `1` to `10` respectively for rows 1 to 10.
- **Column C**: Contains the sum of the corresponding values in columns A and B.

For example:
- Row 1: Column A (`12`) + Column B (`1`) = Column C (`13`)
- Row 2: Column A (`12`) + Column B (`2`) = Column C (`14`)
- ... and so on until Row 10.

## Additional Notes

- The commented-out section provides an alternative approach using Excel formulas directly in the cells.
- The script is flexible and can be modified to handle different ranges or calculations as needed.
