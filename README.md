# Bedsheet Size Data Extraction

This project demonstrates how to extract data from a web page, specifically a bedsheet size chart, and export it to an Excel file using Python. The project utilizes the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas` libraries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of fetching bedsheet size data from a website and organizing it into a structured format that can be easily analyzed or used for further processing. The data is extracted from a table on the webpage and is then exported to an Excel file.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- `requests`: To make HTTP requests and fetch the HTML content from the web page.
- `BeautifulSoup4`: To parse the HTML content and extract the required data.
- `pandas`: To organize the extracted data into a DataFrame and export it to an Excel file.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## Project Workflow

1. **Fetch HTML Content**: The script starts by sending an HTTP GET request to the specified URL to fetch the HTML content of the web page.

2. **Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup**: The fetched HTML content is then parsed using BeautifulSoup to create a parse tree, allowing for easy extraction of specific elements.

3. **Extract Data**: The script locates the table containing the bedsheet size data and extracts all rows (`<tr>` tags) from the table. Each row is further broken down into individual cells (`<td>` tags), and the text content is extracted and cleaned.

4. **Organize Data**: The extracted data is organized into a list of lists, which is then converted into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is structured with columns corresponding to the type of bedsheet and its respective dimensions.

5. **Export to Excel**: Finally, the DataFrame is exported to an Excel file named `Sheet.xlsx`. The index is not included in the Excel file for a cleaner output.

## Running the Script

Simply run the Python script in your preferred environment:

```bash
python script.py
```

After execution, the bedsheet size data will be saved in an Excel file named `Sheet.xlsx` in the same directory as the script.

## Note

Ensure that the URL in the script points to the correct webpage containing the bedsheet size chart. The structure of the table on the webpage should match the scriptâ€™s parsing logic.
